In the Patient class, declare the following private fields:

double height
string name
and define the following public methods:

getHeight() has no parameters and returns the height field.
getName() has no parameters and returns the name field.
Ex: If the input is 4.5 Neha, then the output is:

Height: 4.5

Note: If a field is not properly declared as private, an error message will be output.
